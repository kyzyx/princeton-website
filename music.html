        Here is some of the stuff I've composed, arranged, or transcribed. I enjoy imitating known styles, sometimes with sprinkles of
        a different one; you aren't going to find radical new pieces here. <br>
        Most of it is coursework. Some of it isn't. All of it is messy.
        <h2> Coursework - Theory Classes (MUS106, MUS206) </h2>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="music/Meme_Nocturne.pdf">Nocturne in the Style of Chopin</a> (Piano): Final project for MUS206, a Chopin-esque Nocturne.
            Fun twist: Both of the main themes are from Internet memes.</li>
            <li><a href="music/Prelude.pdf">Prelude in the Style of Bach</a> (Violin): Very short and hastily done for MUS206, in imitation
            of unaccompanied Bach Sonatas/Partitas</li>
            <li><a href="music/sonatina.pdf">Sonatina in the Style of Clementi</a> (Piano): Early project from MUS206. Usually elicits brief nostalgia followed quickly by boredom.</li>
            <li><a href="music/Sonata_Exposition-Development.pdf">Sonata Exposition & Development in the Style of Mozart</a> (Piano):
            Uninspired demonstration of sonata-form. Stops at recapitulation</li>
            <li><a href="music/Train_of_Thought.pdf">Train of Thought</a> (Piano): A minimalist piece inspired by the sounds of Arvo Part
            and Philip Glass. Final project for MUS106. </li>
        </ul>
        <h2> Coursework - MUS210 Composition Through Performance (Spring 2011)</h2>
        This course, taught by Paul Lansky, emphasized improvisation, workshopping and performance. We generally were given an
        instrumentation to compose for, spent one or two days on the sketch, workshopped it, and then slightly polished it before
        recording.
        <ul>
            <li><a href="music/AllThisTime.mp3">All This Time</a> (2 Voices, Piano, Drumkit): Cheesy style, cheesy lyrics. I was most
            interested in the piano texture.
            <br>
            <audio controls='controls'><source src="music/AllThisTime.mp3" type="audio/mpeg"><source src="music/AllThisTime.ogg" type="audio/ogg"></audio></li>
            <li><a href="music/Journey.mp3">Journey Through a Fantasy World</a> (2 Violins &amp; Piano): Fun piece reminiscent of fantasy
            movie soundtracks and video game music. A good deal of inspiration was drawn from Legend of Zelda.
            <br>
            <audio controls='controls'><source src="music/Journey.mp3" type="audio/mpeg"><source src="music/Journey.ogg" type="audio/ogg"></audio></li>
            <li><a href="music/Theft.mp3">Theft</a> (Voice, Violin, Piano, Guitar): This project required us to base a composition on an
            existing piece. Guess which! This piece was a lot of fun to play; the lyrics are totally random.
            <br>
            <audio controls='controls'><source src="music/Theft.mp3" type="audio/mpeg"><source src="music/Theft.ogg" type="audio/ogg"></audio></li>
        </ul>
        <h2> Other </h2>
        In the past I have done transcriptions and arrangements, mostly of soundtracks from games or shows that do not release sheet music.
        Transcription from audio is an interesting challenge.
