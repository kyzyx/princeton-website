        <h1> COS526 Fall 2012 - Assignment 2: Laplacian Meshes </h1>
        <h2> Edward Zhang (edwardz)</h2>
        Laplacian meshes represent vertex locations relative to neighboring vertices. This is useful for deforming meshes, since with a regular mesh, you have to
        drag lots of vertices to new locations to change the mesh's shape; with
        Laplacian mesh representations this becomes a single change. Imagine you
        had a model of a human in a neutral pose; with a Laplacian mesh, to
        raise their arm, you could just drag their elbow into a different position and the rest of the arm would move with it (whereas with a normal mesh, only that vertex on the elbow would move but not changing the pose at all).
        <br>
        I implemented a Mesh class that used Laplacian Mesh representations to perform
        several operations. I made use of the CSparse library for sparse matrix operations.

        <!-- ############################################################# -->
        <h2> Mesh Representation </h2>
        There are two fundamental variables that are used for the mesh representation. The first
        is the symmetric Laplacian matrix. This matrix, a CSparse matrix, is constructed via the
        vertex adjacencies of the mesh. Alternatively, the cotangent weights or the mean value
        weights could have been used.

        After constructing a Laplacian matrix, the differential coordinates for each of the
        x, y, and z coordinates can be constructed by multiplying the Laplacian by the original
        coordinates. These coordinates represent the difference between the average position of
        its neighbors and the vertex's actual position, which corresponds to local detail.

        When reconstructing and deforming a mesh, we must add at least one more row to the Laplacian Matrix to make its rank
        greater than or equal to the number of vertices in the mesh.
        These rows consists of a large constant <i>c></i> at the column corresponding to the vertex to be fixed. When
        solving for vertex Cartesian coordinates from the differential coordinates and the Laplacian, we also need to add rows
        to the differential coordinates. The row in the differential coordinate vector corresponding to the vertex being fixed at
        point (<i>x,y,z</i>) is set to <i>cx, cy, cz</i> in the differential coordinate vector for each coordinate, respectively.
        This weight <i>c</i> is chosen to be a very large constant (1e10) so that Laplacian coordinates will not "pull them away" from the
        desired location.

        <h2> Mesh Reconstruction </h2>
        When reconstructing a mesh, we simply need to set the location of one vertex, i.e. add one row to the Laplacian matrix.

        <h2> Mesh Deformation and Region of Interest Deformation </h2>
        To perform mesh deformation, we simply specify more than one vertex location to be fixed. The
        manipulations of the Laplacian Matrix and the differential coordinate vector is exactly as described above.
        <table>
            <tr>
                <td><img src="output/sel_ico.jpg"></td><td><img src="output/deform_ico.jpg"></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td> Original Icosahedron</td><td> Deformed Icosahedron </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><img src="output/sel_cheetah.jpg"></td><td><img src="output/deform_cheetah.jpg"></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td> Original Cheetah</td><td> Deformed Cheetah </td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        I also implemented Region of Interest Deformation. To do this, I implemented a simplified
        version of Dijkstra's algorithm that, given a control vertex and a radius <i>r</i>, determined all vertices
        whose geodesic distance from it was greater than <i>r</i>. In contrast to a full
        Dijkstra search, which provides all distances from the control point, I could terminate the
        search once no vertex in the priority queue were closer than <i>r</i>(i.e. I had already
        visited all points that were less than the radius away from the control point).
        This was supplied as part of a function that returned a list of all vertices greater than <i>r</i> away from a vertex <i>v</i>. The lap client program then treated these vertices as a second set of
        anchor points.<br>
        The lap client provides the following interface for using the ROI code: After selecting one
        control point, you can press '+' to start using the ROI tool. Pressing '+' repeatedly will
        increase the radius (i.e. the number of points that can move with the control point) and '-'
        will decrease the radius again. The fixed points will be highlighted as green nodes.

        <h2>Parameterization</h2>
        Parameterization is performed by setting all the Laplacian coordinates to 0. Intuitively, this
        means that each vertex is exactly the average of its neighbors, which only happens on a flat
        surface.
        <br>
        The interface for using this works as follows. In the client viewer program, the user selects
        two adjacent vertices and then presses 'p'. This causes the two triangles adjacent to the edge
        between the two vertices to be removed, and the four corners of that quadrilateral are set
        as vertices of the unit square. The Laplacian for all other vertices is set to zero and the
        system solved as above.
        <br>
        It is necessary to replace the rows of the Laplacian involving the four corners with the
        fixed rows (<i>c</i> along the diagonal) instead of leaving those rows as in the regular
        Laplacian, since otherwise other vertices tend to get pulled out of the square or very close
        to the corners, since the fixed corner vertex Laplacians pull their neighbors towards them.
        <br> Note the extreme distortion and the difference in density between the middle of the square
        and the sides. This distortion makes this a rather poor method of parameterization, as can
        be seen in the texture mapping example.

        <h2>Texture Mapping</h2>
        Texture mapping uses the parameterization subroutine described above. It maps the corners of
        the square to the corners of a specified texture; other vertices are mapped based on their
        coordinates in the parameterized square. Note the severe distortion near the cut out square -
        the checkerboard is very dense near the removed square, and very spread out far away from it.

        <h2>Membrane Surface Interpolation</h2>
        Membrane Surface Interpolation "shrink-wraps" the mesh around the anchored points.
        It works by setting the Laplacian at non-anchored vertices to 0.
        <table>
            <tr>
                <td><img src="output/sel_mem_dra.jpg"></td><td><img src="output/mem_dra.jpg"></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td> Original Dragon</td><td>Membrane Surface Dragon</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><img src="output/sel_mem_cheetah.jpg"></td><td><img src="output/mem_cheetah.jpg"></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td> Original Cheetah</td><td> Membrane Surface Cheetah </td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        <hr>
        <!-- ############################################################# -->
        <h2>Surface Function Interpolation</h2>
        Instead of solving for x, y, and z coordinates, we can also solve for functions on the surface
        of the mesh using the Laplacian and the differential coordinates as well. To do this, we use the
        fixed function values instead of the fixed coordinate values and set the laplacian coordinates
        to 0 everywhere else. This creates a smooth interpolation because the value of the function at
        each vertex tends to be the average of the values of its neighbors.
        <br>
        To produce these I set the values of 3 vertices at fairly arbitrary locations to positive and
        negative values on the order of 100s.
