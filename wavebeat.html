        <h2>WaveBeat: A Conducting System for User-Focused Gesture Recognition</h2>
        Advisor: Rebecca Fiebrink<br><br>

        <b> TL;DR </b><br> WaveBeat is a conducting system. You define a set of conducting
        gestures, and then WaveBeat will play back a piece of music, following your tempo and
        your chosen gestures in real time.

        <h3> Abstract </h3>
        Many conductor following systems have been designed in the past that use gesture
        recognition and learning algorithms to great effect. Most such systems, however, are based on
        specialized models and are designed and configured by experts in these fields. Being able to
        generalize the use of such gesture recognition and learning algorithms would allow more people
        to harness the power of these fields and use them in a diverse set of applications. To investigate
        the nature of such user-focused generalization, we present the WaveBeat system, a conducting
        system that uses independent, non-specific modules to implement real-time gesture recognition.
        This system can follow both standard conducting patterns as well as user-defined patterns, and
        allows users to configure relevant parameters to suit the algorithms to their needs.
        The user-centric design of WaveBeat demonstrates that, although performance is affected by the
        loss of specificity, it is possible to create functional systems around generalized gesture
        recognition and machine learning components.</td><td><img src='images/wavebeat.jpg' width='300px'></td></tr></table>

        <h3> Overview of the System </h3>
        The WaveBeat system presents a unified interface in which a user can define a beat pattern by
        following a metronome, and then conduct a short piece of music using the defined gestures. To
        recognize conducting gestures, WaveBeat must first translate user gestures into a set of
        numerical data vectors that the learning algorithm can use. For the purposes of portability, we
        use a webcam as the input device; the program senses conducting gestures by tracking the
        location of a brightly colored glove or baton. A feature extractor records the location of the
        object in the webcam's two-dimensional field of view as raw data, which we then use as input to
        the learning algorithm. The learning algorithm used in WaveBeat makes heavy use of the
        implementation of the Fast Dynamic Time Warping (FastDTW) algorithm provided in the java-ml
        machine learning library. During training, WaveBeat uses the raw data provided by the
        feature extractor to train an instance of FastDTW separately for each beat gesture. During
        performance, each vector of raw data is fed to this algorithm and results in a classification for the
        current beat. These classifications are then processed and used to vary the parameters of the
        playback of a piece of music through the <a href='http://chuck.cs.princeton.edu'>ChucK</a> real-time
        programming language. The entire training-performance process is packaged into a user interface that
        simplifies the supervised learning process and allows convenient configuration while hiding the
        details of the learning algorithm used.
