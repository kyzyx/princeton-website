    <h2> About </h2>
    While playing with augmented reality, I found that many of
    the tools I was using were poorly supported. As a reference, I wrote
    up a set of tutorials. My guiding principle is <b>focus</b>.
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>Explanation only where necessary</b> - I will take
            time to explain the stuff the tutorial is on - how to use the API in
            question. However, I will only give a high-level overview of the
            remaining code, for windowing and display.
            If you want to learn more about e.g.
            OpenGL or C++, there are plenty of tutorials that will focus on
            those aspects. I won't confuse you by trying to teach you three APIs
            and a language simultaneously.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b> Concise code </b> - I'll have exactly enough code to make it
            work, and little else. I will sacrifice a bit of structure just to
            save you the trouble of sorting through twice as many header files,
            so that you can focus on the relevant functionality.
        </li>
    </ul>
