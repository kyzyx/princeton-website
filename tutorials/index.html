    <h2> About </h2>
    While playing with augmented reality, I found that many of
    the tools I was using were poorly supported. As a reference, I wrote
    up a set of tutorials. I tried to follow the following two principles:
    <ol>
        <li>
            <b> No unexplained code </b> - Usually, API providers will give you
            mountains of source. It's hard to extricate the relevant functions
            from the windowing system, event handling system, etc. Even some online
            tutorials just shove code at you with a very high level explanation.
            I make sure to describe what each section is doing. Don't worry,
            I won't write you a novel (see next point)
        </li>
        <li>
            <b> Concise code </b> - I'll have exactly enough code to make it
            work, and little else. I will sacrifice a bit of structure just to
            save you the trouble of sorting through twice as many header files,
            so that you can focus on the relevant functionality.
        </li>
    </ol>
