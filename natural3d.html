        <h2>Aligning Gesture Space and Display Space for Natural 3D Manipulation</h2>

        <b> TL;DR </b><br> Use your hands to pick up and move virtual objects floating in front of your screen.

        <h3> Abstract </h3>
        3D graphics are an exciting and versatile method of visualization. However, with the standard interfaces of mouse, keyboard, and 2D screen, interacting with 3D graphics is highly  cumbersome and unintuitive. The ideal system would combine a 3D display with a spatially accurate gesture system, so that the user could interact with the virtual object as if it were a real one.
        <br>
        I have implemented a prototype system using the <a href="http://software.intel.com/en-us/vcsource/tools/perceptual-computing-sdk">Intel Perceptual Computing SDK</a> and <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/3d-vision-and-surround-technology">Nvidia 3D automatic</a> that successfully aligns the user's hand and
        the 3D object in space. If you see an object 40cm in front of you, you
        can reach out and move it as if it were an actual object floating there.
        The main focus of the prototype is for a user study to compare whether
        the natural interaction and display is advantageous to users. Previous
        in-air gestural systems have shown low accuracy compared to the mouse;
        however preliminary results have suggested that, when coupled with
        the 3D display space, gestural systems are much faster and more intuitive.
        <br>
        Future works will include head tracking (the current alignment system is only static viewpoint) and automatic alignment.
