The body of academic literature is enormous. Performing research involves the
daunting task of searching through this sea of works and determining which papers
are relevant to a particular query. Furthermore, it is difficult to assess the
relative importance of a paper - it is not obvious from reading a paper whether it 
introduces novel ideas, or adds depth to the field in a way only experts are likely 
to appreciate.

<p>
The SAGE system helps researchers navigate through the space of academic works,
allowing them to quickly find closely related works and locate important
similar papers with ease. This is accomplished by visualizing the set of academic papers as
a directed graph. Each paper is a node, with an edge to another if the first references the second. This formulation allows us to
intuitively estimate importance using an heuristic of reference count - an important
paper tends to be referenced many more times than less important papers.

<p>
SAGE allows us to navigate around this graph, presenting the vital metrics of importance
and relevance in a user-friendly manner. For any user, whether student,
academic, professional, or layperson, SAGE facilitates rapid discovery of
important information in potentially unfamiliar fields.
